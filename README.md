# ESM 244 (Winter 2020)
## Lab Week 5: Exploring time series data, intro to forecasting

In this lab we'll use the relatively new (and totally awesome) [`feasts`](https://github.com/tidyverts/feasts) and [`fable`](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable) packages to explore, parse and working with time series data. 

We'll explore data from the US Energy Information Administration on [renewable energy consumption by source](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/?tbl=T10.01#/?f=M).

### Packages required: 

- `tidyverse`
- `lubridate`
- `feasts`
- `fable`
